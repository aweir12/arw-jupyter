This repository contains all the necessary code to create a Docker image for Python development using Jupyter Notebook. The image is based on jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest.

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Why these features</h3>
These are my personal preferences for Python Development in Jupyter Notebook.
